# README for AWS SDK for .NET documentation examples

This is a collection of code examples for the AWS SDK for .NET public documentation.
All of the code examples run on version 3.5 of the AWS SDK for .NET using version 3.1 of .NET Core.
Each service directory under this directory contains a **Readme.md** file with information about
the code examples within that service directory.

## Prerequisites

To build and run the code examples in this collection, you need the following:

- The AWS SDK for .NET. For more information, see the [AWS SDK for .NET
Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/latest/developer-guide).

- AWS credentials, either configured in a local AWS credentials file, or by setting the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables.  For more information, see the [AWS Tools and SDKs Shared Configuration and Credentials Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/overview.html).

## Building and running the code examples

To build and run a code example, 
follow the instructions in the README file for the service.
In general, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the directory containing a **.sln** file.
2. Build the solution using ```dotnet build SOLUTION.sln```, 
   where SOLUTION.sln is the name of the **.sln** file.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the code example
   and a **.csproj** file.
4. Run the project using the ```dotnet run``` command.

## Unit tests

All of the code example projects have a companion unit test,
where the name of the unit test project is the same as the tested project,
with a **Test** suffix.

We use [Xunit](https://xunit.net/) as the framework for our unit tests and
in most cases use [moq4](https://github.com/moq/moq4) to create unit tests with mocked objects.
You can create an Xunit project and install the **moq** Nuget package in that project with
the following commands:

```
dotnet new xunit -o MyTestProject
cd MyTestProject
dotnet add package moq
```

A typical unit test looks something like the following,
which tests a call to **CreateTableAsync** in the
**CreateTable** project:

```
using System.Net;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

using Amazon.DynamoDBv2;
using Amazon.DynamoDBv2.Model;

using Moq;

using Xunit;

namespace DynamoDBCRUD
{
    public class UnitTest1
    {
        private static readonly string _tableName = "testtable";

        private IAmazonDynamoDB CreateMockDynamoDBClient()
        {
            var mockDynamoDBClient = new Mock<IAmazonDynamoDB>();

            mockDynamoDBClient.Setup(client => client.CreateTableAsync(
                It.IsAny<CreateTableRequest>(),
                It.IsAny<CancellationToken>()))
                .Callback<CreateTableRequest, CancellationToken>((request, token) =>
                {
                    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(_tableName))
                    {
                        bool areEqual = _tableName == request.TableName;
                        Assert.True(areEqual, "The provided table name is not the one used to create the table");
                    }
                })
                .Returns((CreateTableRequest r, CancellationToken token) =>
                {
                    return Task.FromResult(new CreateTableResponse { HttpStatusCode = HttpStatusCode.OK });
                });

            return mockDynamoDBClient.Object;
        }

        [Fact]
        public async void CheckCreateTable()
        {
            IAmazonDynamoDB client = CreateMockDynamoDBClient();

            var result = await CreateTable.MakeTableAsync(client, _tableName);

            bool ok = result.HttpStatusCode == HttpStatusCode.OK;
            Assert.True(ok, "Could NOT create table " + _tableName);
        }
    }
}
```

To run this test,
navigate to the **CreateTableTest** folder and run:

```
dotnet test
```

If you want more information, run:

```
dotnet test -l "console;verbosity=detailed"
```

## Additional information

- As an AWS best practice, grant all code least privilege, or only the permissions required to perform a task. For more information, see [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) in the *AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide*.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions. Some AWS services are available only in specific Regions. For more information, see [Region Table](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/) on the AWS website.
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
