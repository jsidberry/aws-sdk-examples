### ConfigureLPQueuev2.go

This example configures an Amazon SQS queue to use long polling.

`go run ConfigureLPQueuev2.go -q QUEUE-NAME [-w WAIT-TIME]`

- _QUEUE-NAME_ is the name of the queue to configure.
- _WAIT-TIME_ is how long, in seconds, to wait.
  The example ensures the value is between 1 and 20;
  the default is 10.

The unit test accepts similar values in _config.json_.
