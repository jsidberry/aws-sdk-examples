# UpdateAccessKeyv2.go

This example sets the status of an IAM access key to active.

`go run UpdateAccessKeyv2.go -k KeyID -u USER-NAME`

- _KEYID_ is the access key to activate.
- _USER-NAME_ is the name of the user activating the key.

The unit test accepts similar values in _config.json_.

## Running the unit tests

Unit tests should delete any resources they create.
However, they might result in charges to your
AWS account.

To run a unit test, enter:

`go test`

You should see something like the following,
where PATH is the path to the folder containing the Go files:

```sh
PASS
ok      PATH 6.593s
```

If you want to see any log messages, enter:

`go test -v`

You should see some additional log messages.
The last two lines should be similar to the previous output shown.
