# ListAccessKeysv2.go

This example retrieves the access keys for your IAM account.

`go run ListAccessKeysv2.go -u USER-NAME -m MAX-KEYS`

- _USER-NAME_ is the name of the user for which the keys are listed.
- _MAX-KEYS_ is the maximum number of keys to display.
  If this value is negative, the code example sets it to 10. 

The unit test accepts similar values in _config.json_.

- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Running the unit tests

Unit tests should delete any resources they create.
However, they might result in charges to your
AWS account.

To run a unit test, enter:

`go test`

You should see something like the following,
where PATH is the path to the folder containing the Go files:

```sh
PASS
ok      PATH 6.593s
```

If you want to see any log messages, enter:

`go test -v`

You should see some additional log messages.
The last two lines should be similar to the previous output shown.
