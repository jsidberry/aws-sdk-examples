### PutObjectv1.go

This example creates an Amazon S3 bucket object from a local file.

`go run PutObjectv2.go -b BUCKET -f FILE`

- _BUCKET_ is the name of the bucket to which the file is uploaded.
- _FILE_ is the name of the local file to upload.

The unit test accepts similar values in _config.json_.
