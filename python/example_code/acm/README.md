# AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) basics example

## Purpose

Shows how to use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
to request, import, and manage certificates.

* Request a new certificate from ACM.
* Import a self-signed certificate.
* Retrieve certificate data.
* Add custom tags to certificates.

## Prerequisites

- You must have an AWS account, and have your default credentials and AWS Region
  configured as described in the [AWS Tools and SDKs Shared Configuration and
  Credentials Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/creds-config-files.html).
- Python 3.7 or later
- Boto3 1.14.47 or later
- PyTest 5.3.5 or later (to run unit tests)

## Cautions

- As an AWS best practice, grant this code least privilege, or only the 
  permissions required to perform a task. For more information, see 
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) 
  in the *AWS Identity and Access Management 
  User Guide*.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions. Some AWS services are 
  available only in specific Regions. For more information, see the 
  [AWS Region Table](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/)
  on the AWS website.
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Running the code

Run this example at a command prompt with the following command.

```
python certificate_basics.py
```

The example optionally imports a self-signed certificate to ACM. To do this, it asks 
for certificate and private key files in PEM format. You can create these yourself by
using a certificate toolkit, such as OpenSSL. 

### Example structure

The example contains the following file.

**certificate_basics.py**

Shows how to use ACM APIs. The `usage_demo` script requests a new certificate from
ACM, uploads a self-signed certificate, and gets data about certificates from ACM.

## Running the tests

The unit tests in this module use the botocore Stubber. This captures requests before 
they are sent to AWS, and returns a mocked response. To run all of the tests, 
run the following in your [GitHub root]/python/example_code/acm 
folder.

```    
python -m pytest
```
