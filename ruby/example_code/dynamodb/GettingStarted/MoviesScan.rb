# This code example demonstrates how to search for items in
# an existing table in Amazon DynamoDB named 'Movies'.
# If an item matches the specified search condition, then informaton about
# that item is returned. In this example, a scan operation is performed. The
# scan operation searches through the entire table, which can contain
# thousands of items. In this example, matching items
# must have a 'year' attribute value of 1950 through 1959; however,
# this filter is applied only after the entire table has been
# searched (making it slower than a query operation).
