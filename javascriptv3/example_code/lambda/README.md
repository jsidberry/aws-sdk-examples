# TypeScript environment for AWS Lambda examples
This is a workspace where you can find working AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 AWS Lambda examples. 

The [AWS SDK for JavaScript v3](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3) is available. 

The [AWS documentation for this tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/using-lambda-functions.html) contains these examples.

The [AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 API Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/clients/client-lambda/index.html) contains the API operations for the AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 AWS Lambda client module.

AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume.

This is a workspace where you can find working AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 Lambda examples. 

**NOTE:** The AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 is written in TypeScript so, for consistency, these examples are also in TypeScript. TypeScript extends of JavaScript so these examples can also be run as JavaScript. For more information, see [TypeScript homepage](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

# Getting started

1. Clone the [AWS SDK Code Samples repo](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples) to your local environment. See [the Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) for instructions.

2. Install the dependencies listed in the package.json.

**Note**: These dependencies include the client modules for the AWS services that this example requires, 
which are *@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb*, *@aws-sdk/client-lambda*, *@aws-sdk/client-iam*, 
*@aws-sdk/client-s3*, *@aws-sdk/client-dynamoDB*, *@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity*, 
*@aws-sdk/credential-provider-cognito-identity*, and *@aws-sdk/client-lambda*.
```
npm install ts-node -g # If using JavaScript, enter 'npm install node -g' instead
cd javascriptv3/example_code/lambda
npm install
```
