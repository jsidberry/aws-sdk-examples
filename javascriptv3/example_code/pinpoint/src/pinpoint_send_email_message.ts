/* The address on the "To" line. If your Amazon Pinpoint account is in
the sandbox, this address also has to be verified.
Note: All recipient addresses in this example are in arrays, which makes it
easier to specify multiple recipients. Alternatively, you can make these
variables strings, and then modify the To/Cc/BccAddresses attributes in the
params variable so that it passes an array for each recipient type.*/
