# TypeScript environment for Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM) examples
This is a workspace where you can find working AWS SDK for JavaScript version 3 (v3) Amazon IAM examples. 

The [AWS SDK for JavaScript v3](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3) is available. 

The [AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/iam-examples.html) contains these examples.

The [AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 API Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/clients/client-iam/index.html) contains the API operations for the AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 Amazon IAM client module.

Amazon IAM enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.


**NOTE:** The AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 is written in TypeScript so, for consistency, these examples are also in TypeScript. TypeScript extends of JavaScript so these examples can also be run as JavaScript. For more information, see [TypeScript homepage](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

# Getting started

1. Clone the [AWS SDK Code Samples repo](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples) to your local environment. See [the Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) for instructions.

2. Install the dependencies listed in the package.json in the folder containing the example(s).

**Note**: These dependencies include the client modules for the AWS services that this example requires, 
which are *@aws-sdk/client-iam* and *@aws-sdk/client-sts*.
```
npm install ts-node -g # If using JavaScript, enter 'npm install node -g' instead
cd javascriptv3/example_code/iam
npm install
```

3. If you're using JavaScript, change the sample file extension from ```.ts``` to ```.js```.


4. In your text editor, update user variables specified in the ```Inputs``` section of the sample file.

5. Run sample code:
```
cd src
ts-node [example name].ts // e.g., ts-node iam_accesskeylastused.ts
```
